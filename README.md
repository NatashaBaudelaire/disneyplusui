## Objective

The main goal of this project was to recreate the Disney+ interface using modern web technologies, applying **HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (ES6+)**. The content is dynamically generated through The Movie Database **(TMDB)** API, which provides detailed film information such as title, synopsis, cover image, background image, and rating, complemented by images enhanced in Photoshop for improved visual quality.
