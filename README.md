## Objective  
The main goal of this project was to recreate the Disney Plus streaming platform interface using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)**. The content is generated dynamically using **The Movie Database (TMDB)** API, which provides movie information such as title, synopsis, cover image, background image, and rating.
